# Project Proposal
## Idea
Data assimilation of satellite data, and low-cost PM2.5 sensor network to produce AOD values with ground-based measurement as reference.
## Quirks
Combine with meteorological conditions
Cloud-free measurement from satellites only
Comparison of results between cloudy and cloud-free results

# Proposal 2
## Idea  
Regression of WL measurement with mass concentration for coal and silica
## Quirks
Coal is easy and silica is hard.
